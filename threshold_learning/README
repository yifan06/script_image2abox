A set of scripts in this folder is used to decide a threshold for quantification of spatial measurements in image. 

tolearn.zsh gets all the corresponding lists of spatial structures belonging to certain relations and calls  computeRelation.zsh to evaluate a numerical satisfaction degree.

computeRelation.zsh: extraction of segmented structures and computation of spatial relations with the script spatialRelation.zsh.

spatialRelation.zsh: evaluation of distances and directions between two objects.

function.zsh function_ima.zsh provide a set of small tools such as checking exsistence of files and conversion of images. (not all can be applied directly for service)



In the real application, all pairs of structures in the database (both healthy and pathological case) are extracted and all the spatial relations are evaluated by comp_histo_angle3d.zsh using the method of histogram of angles. 
For each relations, we separates the whole set into two parts (this part is done manully). The threshold is learned by a matlab code.

All brain structures in the dataset are segemented and saved in the folder "allstructures".
All histograms of angles between each pair of structures are saved in the folder  "histo".
The folder "output_intersect" consists of satisfaction degrees computed by intersection of relation fuzzy set and histogram of angles.
The folder "output_cc" consists of satisfaction degrees computed by gravity of compatiblility center.
